# Idea

I have looked on different options how to create and host personal page. As I want it to be stable and safe enough I decided to go with Github Pages.

# Process

## Choosing theme

From looking in Jekyll theme list was hard to find something I was interested. But when I found one I understood that I need to update it much more.
I Understood that this theme is just base to start of. Theme I found as starting point is **TeXt**.

## Updating look

First steps in updating site was to try to add blocks of information related to projects that I want to get into more. So I tried to add information about them.
From looking in theme homepage I found some good tips but because of choosen color pallete elements did not looked as nice as I was planning. So I explored more
to see solutions. I found out that I need to update functionality and styles myself already in starting point. So I took work in my hands.
